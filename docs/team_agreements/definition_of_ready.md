# Definition of Ready

This document lists the agreed upon practices the team will be using. As they are discussed and changed, update this file accordingly.

## DoR criteria

A “ready” backlog item needs to be clear, feasible and testable:

- A user story is clear if all Scrum team members have a shared understanding of what it means. Collaboratively writing user stories, and adding acceptance criteria to the high-priority ones facilitates clarity
- An item is testable if there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected. Acceptance criteria ensure that each story can be tested
- A user story is feasible if it can be completed in one sprint, according to the Definition of Done. If this is not achievable, it needs be broken down further
